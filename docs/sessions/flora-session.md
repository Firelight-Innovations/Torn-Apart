## What shipped
Procedural, seeded flora rendered as GPU-instanced crossed-quad pixel-art
sprites — the grass idiom generalised over a kind table. No CPU per-plant
state, no save bytes, deterministic per world seed.

- **`procedural/textures/`** — three new seeded sprite atlases:
  `flower_sprite` (32×128, 4 hue variants), `bush_sprite` (48×144, 3
  condition variants), `tree_sprite` (96×192, 3 condition variants, 2:3
  cells). All binary-alpha cutouts, posterised wasteland palettes.
  Preview: `python tools/preview_texture.py tree_sprite`.
- **`zones/flora_placement.py`** — `FLORA_KINDS`, `flora_hash_seed`,
  `flora_instance_count`, `flora_instance_attribs` (the flora.vert mirror:
  grass chain + h5 variant link, constant `0x165667B1`; parameterised scale
  range). Height fields reuse `bake_grass_height_field` unchanged.
- **`world/flora_renderer.py` + `world/shaders/flora.vert/.frag`** —
  `FloraRendererComponent`, table-driven over `_FLORA_KINDS` (tag, atlas,
  quads, sway gain/pivot, fades, light offset). Same dual wind path as
  grass (`u_wind_tex` field / scalar SkyState fallback); trees pin the
  trunk (`u_sway_pivot` 0.45, gain 0.15), flowers bend like blades.
- **Config** — new `[flora]` table: per-kind density/height/fade/cap
  (defaults: flowers 1.5/m² 0.45 m, bushes 0.08/m² 1.3 m, trees 0.02/m²
  7 m, tree fade 300–380 m).
- **main.py** — demo `"flowers"` + `"bushes"` volumes around the grass box;
  the existing demo `"trees"` volume now grows tree sprites over its leaf
  litter. Component wired at step 10c2.
- **Tests** — `tests/test_flora.py` (22): atlas determinism/invariants,
  count/seed math, attrib mirror vs grass chain, GLSL constant pins.

## Verified
- Full suite 637 passed.
- `tools/screenshot.py --pitch -8 [--yaw -50]` → `tools/out/flora_meadow.png`,
  `flora_trees.png`: trees/bushes/flowers stand on terrain, lit by cascades.

## Gotchas found
- `flora.vert` ↔ `flora_instance_attribs` is a THIRD mirror pair (after
  grass and motes) — edit both or neither.
- A `"trees"` volume has TWO consumers (flora trees + wind leaf litter) on
  distinct `for_domain` keys; `params["density"]` is the tree density,
  `params["leaf_density"]` the litter density.
- Tree atlas: the first canopy lobe is pinned to the crown — without it,
  sparse variants rendered floating canopies.

## Left for the owner / next session
- DECISIONS.md flora entry appended but **left uncommitted** (the file
  carries another active session's uncommitted entries — commit it from
  whichever session finishes last).
- Densities/fades are first-pass eyeball values; tune in `[flora]`.
- Possible follow-ups: biome-driven volume placement (BiomeDef), more tree
  species atlases (per-kind `params` could pick a def name), collision once
  walking lands.
